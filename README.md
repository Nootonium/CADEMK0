# C.A.D.E. - Comprehensive Automated Digital E-butler

## Description
CADE (Comprehensive Automated Digital E-butler) is a backend application developed to store and manage messages received through a contact form from a web portfolio. It's built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and follows good practices for production-level code, including a test suite, logging, error handling, and continuous integration.

## Features
- REST API that receives and stores contact form messages.
- MongoDB database to store messages.
- Robust logging system using Winston.
- Comprehensive test suite with Jest.
- Continuous Integration through GitHub Actions.
- Implements rate limiting and CORS for enhanced security.

## Future Enhancements
The following are some ideas for features that could be added to CADE in the future:

- **Automated Responses**: Set up your backend to automatically respond to specific requests. Utilize a language model like ChatGPT to generate predetermined responses based on keywords.

- **Data Analytics**: Implement data analytics capabilities in your backend. Analyze data from your website or app to extract insights such as user behavior, peak usage times, and common navigation paths.

- **Scheduling and Calendar Management**: Interface your backend with a service like Google Calendar to handle event scheduling, updates, and deletions. Implement functionality to provide reminders for upcoming events or deadlines.

- **Expense Tracker**: Create an expense tracking feature in your backend to record and categorize expenses. Enable tracking of where your money is being spent and assist with budgeting.

- **Task Management**: Develop a task management system where you can add, update, and delete tasks. Include features to track the status of each task (e.g., pending, in progress, completed).

Please note that these are just ideas and the feasibility of implementing them would depend on several factors, including the specific requirements of your application, your resources, and the time you have available.

## Getting Started
