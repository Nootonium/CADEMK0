# C.A.D.E. - Comprehensive Automated Digital E-butler

## Description
CADE is a multifaceted backend application designed to streamline communication and project management tasks. Originally developed to handle messages from a contact form in a web portfolio, CADE now boasts a robust Discord bot feature. This bot extends the application's capabilities into the realm of Discord, facilitating seamless message management and real-time engagement with your audience or team members.

## Features
- **Contact Form Message Management**: CADE elevates the standard functionality of message handling by not only securely storing and cataloging messages received from a web portfolio's contact form but also engaging in intelligent conversation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the workflow:
  - **Reception**: On receiving a message, CADE securely logs and stores it within the MongoDB database for easy access and management.
  - **Interaction with ChatGPT**: CADE then forwards the message to ChatGPT, which formulates a contextually relevant response based on the inquiry.
  - **Automated Email Response**: Once the response is parsed and tailored, CADE dispatches it via email, ensuring a timely and thoughtful reply to the initial contact.

- **Discord Bot Integration**: Engage with users directly through Discord, with features that include:
  - Automated responses and interactive communication
  - Pull Request (PR) tracking from GitHub with updates and status reports within your Discord channels

## Future Enhancements
The following are some ideas for features that could be added to CADE in the future:

- **Automated Responses**: Set up your backend to automatically respond to specific requests. Utilize a language model like ChatGPT to generate predetermined responses based on keywords.

- **GitHub Integration**: Extend the bot's capabilities with GitHub integration, allowing for real-time updates, issues, and other repository activities.
